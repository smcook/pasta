    ¼ cup olive oil

    1 small garlic clove, finely grated
    ½ cup tomato paste
    2 tablespoons vodka
    1 cup heavy cream
    1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

### Recipe Preparation

<b>Sauce</b>
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. 
- Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until paste is brick red and starts to caramelize, about 5 minutes. 
- Add vodka and cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. 
- Add cream and red pepper flakes and stir until well blended. 
- Season with salt and pepper; remove from heat.

<b>Pasta</b>
- Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. 
- Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. 
- Add pasta to skillet with sauce along with butter and ½ cup pasta cooking liquid. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly 
  and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until butter has melted and a thick, glossy sauce has formed, about 2 minutes. 
- Season with salt and pepper and add 1 oz. Parmesan, tossing to coat. 
- Divide pasta among bowls, then top with basil and more Parmesan.
